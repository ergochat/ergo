# Oragono's Translations

These translations have been contributed by amazing people using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/oragono). If you'd like to fix up a mistake or help add a language, feel free to pop over there! Always interested in new contributors and language support.

Contributors to translations are noted in the translation's info file (the `yaml` file). You shouldn't be touching these files manually – they should be getting updated through CrowdIn. However, the `example` files exist if you want a reference for the format. To regenerate the `example` files (that get fed into CrowdIn), look at the `updatetranslations.py` file in the source directory.

My eventual intent is to use these translations to help create a standard set that other IRC software authors can see, download, and use in their own software (with proper attribution to the contributors, of course).
