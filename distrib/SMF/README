This directory contains Service Management Facility service files for ergo.
These files should be compatible with current OpenSolaris / Illumos based operating systems. Tested on OpenIndiana.

Prerequesites:
	- ergo binary located at /opt/ergo/ergo
	- ergo configuration located at /opt/ergo/ircd.yaml (hardcoded)
	- ergo languages located at /opt/ergo/languages (to be compatible with default.yaml - you may adjust this path or disable languages in your custom ircd.yaml)
	- ergo certificate and key located at /opt/ergo/fullchain.pem /opt/ergo/privkey.pem (to be compatible with default.yaml - you may adjust these paths in your custom ircd.yaml)
	- `ergo` role user and `ergo` role group owning all of the above

Installation:
	- cp ergo.xml /lib/svc/manifest/network/
	- cp ergo /lib/svc/method/
	- svcadm restart manifest-import

Usage:

	- svcs ergo (Check status)
	- svcadm refresh ergo (Reload manifest and ergo configuration)
	- svcadm disable ergo (Stop)
