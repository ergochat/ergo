# This is the "conventional" or "mainstream" config file for Oragono.
# It tries to replicate the behavior of other ircds, at the cost of not
# taking full advantage of Oragono's features. This config is suitable for use
# in IRCv3 conformance testing.

    # addresses to listen on
    listeners:
        # This version of the config provides a public plaintext listener on
        # port 6667 for testing and compatibility with legacy applications.
        # We recommend disabling this listener in a production setting
        # and replacing it with loopback-only listeners (see default.yaml):
        ":6667":

        # The standard SSL/TLS port for IRC is 6697. This will listen on all interfaces:
        ":6697":
            tls:
                cert: fullchain.pem
                key: privkey.pem
                # 'proxy' should typically be false. It's only for Kubernetes-style load
                # balancing that does not terminate TLS, but sends an initial PROXY line
                # in plaintext.
                proxy: false

        # Example of a Unix domain socket for proxying:
        # "/tmp/oragono_sock":

        # Example of a Tor listener: any connection that comes in on this listener will
        # be considered a Tor connection. It is strongly recommended that this listener
        # *not* be on a public interface --- it should be on 127.0.0.0/8 or unix domain:
        # "/hidden_service_sockets/oragono_tor_sock":
        #     tor: true

        # Example of a WebSocket listener:
        # ":8097":

        #         cert: fullchain.pem
        #         key: privkey.pem

    # sets the permissions for Unix listen sockets. on a typical Linux system,
    # the default is 0775 or 0755, which prevents other users/groups from connecting
    # to the socket. With 0777, it behaves like a normal TCP socket
    # where anyone can connect.
