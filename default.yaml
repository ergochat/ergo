# This is the default config file for Ergo.
# It contains recommended defaults for all settings, including some behaviors
# that differ from conventional ircd+services setups. See traditional.yaml
# for a config with more "mainstream" behavior.
#
# If you are setting up a new Ergo server, you should copy this file
# to a new one named 'ircd.yaml', then look through the file to see which
# settings you want to customize. If you don't understand a setting, or
# aren't sure what behavior you want, most of the defaults are fine
# to start with (you can change them later, even on a running server).
# However, there are a few that you should probably change up front:
# 1. network.name (a human-readable name that identifies your network,
#    no spaces or special characters) and server.name (consider using the
#    domain name of your server)
# 2. if you have valid TLS certificates (for example, from letsencrypt.org),
#    you should enable them in server.listeners in place of the default
#    self-signed certificates
# 3. the operator password in the 'opers' section
# 4. by default, message history is enabled, using in-memory history storage
#    and with messages expiring after 7 days. depending on your needs, you may
#    want to disable history entirely, remove the expiration time, switch to
#    persistent history stored in MySQL, or do something else entirely. See
#    the 'history' section of the config.

        # The standard plaintext port for IRC is 6667. Allowing plaintext over the
        # public Internet poses serious security and privacy issues. Accordingly,
        # we recommend using plaintext only on local (loopback) interfaces:
        "127.0.0.1:6667": # (loopback ipv4, localhost-only)
        "[::1]:6667":     # (loopback ipv6, localhost-only)

        # two lines and uncomment the line below (which listens on all interfaces):

        # Alternately, if you have a TLS certificate issued by a recognized CA,
