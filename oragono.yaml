        "[::1]:6667":     # (loopback ipv6, localhost-only)

        # two lines and uncomment the line below (which listens on all interfaces):
        # ":6667":
        # Alternately, if you have a TLS certificate issued by a recognized CA,
        # you can configure port 6667 as an STS-only listener that only serves
        # "redirects" to the TLS port, but doesn't allow chat. See the manual
